## @cached

This decorator can improve performance a lot. It will cache your functions / properties to avoid unnecessary computational intensive repetitions. Especially indicator calculations that are called often are perfect candidates for this. The cache is cleared every new candle behind the scene.

**Example**:
```py
    from jesse.strategies import Strategy, cached

    @property
    @cached
    def donchian(self):
        return ta.donchian(self.candles)
```
::: warning
If you use it with `@property` make sure the order is right like above. Otherwise you will get an error.
:::

## available_margin

Returns the available/remaining margin in your exchange wallet. It equals to your initial wallet balance multiplied by the leverage you're using, added by the unrealized profits on your open positions, subtracted by spent margin for open orders. 

For the sake of not getting liquidated, it is safer to just use the [capital](#capital) property in your strategies instead. 

It is meant to be used in the futures markets only although in the spot market it equals to the `self.balance` property. 

**Return Type**: float

**See Also**: [balance](#balance), [capital](#capital)


## average\_entry\_price

The average entry price; buy price for long and sell price for short positions. The word average indicates that in case you use more than one point to enter a position, this property returns the average value. 

**Return Type**: float


**Example**:
```py{14}
def go_long(self):
    qty = 2

    # self.average_entry_price is equal to (100 + 120) / 2 == 110
    self.buy = [
        (1, 100), 
        (1, 120)
    ]
    self.stop_loss = qty, 80
    self.take_profit = qty, 140

def filter_min_pnl(self):
    min_pnl = 1
    reward_per_qty = abs(self.average_take_profit - self.average_entry_price)
    return (reward_per_qty / self.average_entry_price) * 100 > min_pnl
```

::: warning
Note that `average_entry_price` is only available after `go_long()` or `go_short()` is executed. Hence, it is only supposed to be used in either filter functions or when the position is open. 

In other words, you cannot use it inside `should_long()` and `should_short()`.
:::

**See Also**: [average_take_profit](#average-take-profit), [average_stop_loss](#average-stop-loss)

## average\_stop\_loss

Same as [average_entry_price](#average-entry-price) but for stop-loss. The word average indicates that in case you use more than one point for stop-loss, this property returns the average value. 

**Return Type**: float

**See Also**: [average_entry_price](#average-entry-price), [average_take_profit](#average-take-profit)

## average\_take\_profit

Same as [average_entry_price](#average-entry-price) but for take-profit. The word average indicates that in case you use more than one point for take-profit, this property returns the average value. 

**Return Type**: float

**See Also**: [average_entry_price](#average-entry-price), [average_stop_loss](#average-stop-loss)

## balance

Returns the current wallet in your exchange wallet. In the futures market, it behaves exactly as "wallet balance in USDT" does on [Binance Futures](http://jesse.trade/binance).

**Return Type**: float

**Aliases**: `capital`

**See Also**: [capital](#capital), [available_margin](#available-margin)


## candles

This property returns candles for current trading exchange, symbol, and timeframe. Is it frequently used when using [technical indicators](/docs/indicators) because the first parameter for all indicators is `candles`. 

Each candle's timestamp is the beginning of that time period, not the ending but the actual time it began.

The candles are grouped according to the exchange-pairs' timeframe set in routes.py.

**Return Type:** np.ndarray

**Example**:
```py
# get SMA with a period of 8 for current trading route
sma8 = ta.sma(self.candles, 8)
```

**Example**:
```py
# get candles details - current trading route timeframe is '1h'
lastcandle = self.candles[-1]
print(lastcandle)  # [1.61982720e+12 5.76972500e+04 5.78114200e+04 5.80880000e+04 5.74210500e+04 3.48044949e+03]
timestamp_ms = lastcandle[0] # Saturday, May 1, 2021 12:00:00 AM
open = lastcandle[1]
close = lastcandle[2]
high = lastcandle[3]
low = lastcandle[4]
volume = lastcandle[5]
```

## capital

Alias for [balance](#balance)


## close

Alias for [price](#price)

## current_candle

Returns the current candle in the form of a numpy array.

**Return Type**: np.ndarray

```
[
    timestamp,
    open,
    close,
    high,
    low,
    volume
]
```

**Example**:

```py
from pprint import pprint

pprint(self.current_candle)
# array([1.54638714e+12, 3.79409000e+03, 3.79714000e+03, 3.79800000e+03,
#        3.79400000e+03, 1.30908000e+02])

pprint(self.current_candle.dtype)
# dtype('float64')
```

You could get timestamp, open, close, high, low, and volume from candle array:

```py
timestamp = self.current_candle[0]
open_price = self.current_candle[1]
close_price = self.current_candle[2]
high_price = self.current_candle[3]
low_price = self.current_candle[4]
volume = self.current_candle[5]
```

**See Also**: [price](#price), [close](#close), [open](#open), [high](#high), [low](#low)

## fee_rate

The `fee_rate` property returns the fee rate that the exchange your strategy is trading on uses. This property is most commonly used as a parameter for [risk_to_qty](/docs/utils.html#risk-to-qty). 

**Example:**
```py
qty = utils.risk_to_qty(self.capital, 3, entry, stop, self.fee_rate)
```

**Return Type**: float

**See Also**: [risk_to_qty](/docs/utils.html#risk-to-qty)

::: tip
The `fee_rate` property returns exchange fee as a float. For example at Binance fee is `0.1%`, hence `self.fee_rate` would return `0.001`.
:::


## get_candles

This method returns candles for the exchange, symbol, and timeframe that you specify, unlike `self.candles` which returns candles for the current route. 

```py
get_candles(exchange: str, symbol: str, timeframe: str)
```

For simple strategies that trade only one route and use only one timeframe, `self.candles` is probably the way to go. Otherwise, use `self.get_candles()`.

**Return Type:** np.ndarray

**Example**:
```py
@property
def big_trend(self):
    """
    Uses the SRSI indicator to determine the bigger trend of the market. 
    The trading timeframe is "4h" so we use "1D" timeframe as the anchor timeframe.
    """
    k, d = ta.srsi(self.get_candles(self.exchange, self.symbol, '1D'))

    if k > d:
        return 1
    elif k < d:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
```

**See Also**: [candles](#candles)

## high

The current candle's high price.

**Return Type**: float

**Example**:

```py
def go_long(self):
    qty = 1

    # open position at 2 dollars above current candle's high
    self.buy = qty, self.high + 2
```

## increased_count

How many times has the position size been increased since this trade was opened? 

This is useful for strategies that for example enter/exit in multiple points, and you'd like to update something related to it.

**Return Type**: int

This property is useful if: 
1. You have been trying to open position in more than one point:
```py
def go_long(self):
    self.buy = [
        (0.5, self.price + 10),
        # after this point self.increased_count will be 1
        (0.5, self.price + 20), 
        # after this point self.increased_count will be 2
        (0.5, self.price + 30), 
        # after this point self.increased_count will be 3
    ]
```

2. You decide to increase the size of the open position because of some factor of yours:

```py
def update_position(self):
    # momentum_rank being a method you've defined somewhere that
    # examines the momentum of the current trend or something
    if self.momentum_rank > 100:
        if self.is_long:
            # buy qty of 1 for the current price (MARKET order)
            self.buy = 1, self.price
```


## index

The `index` property is a counter which can be used to detect how many times the strategy has been executed. Imagine we're doing a loop in backtest mode, and this index is the index of that loop. The below examples can explain it better.

**Return Type**: int

**Example:**

```py
# example #1: go long when the first candle is received
def should_long(self):
    return self.index == 0

# example #2: let's say there are some expensive operations in a  
# method I've defined called do_slow_updates() (like machine learning stuff)
# that I'd like to do once a day while trading "1m" candles
def before(self):
    if self.index % 1440 == 0:
        do_slow_updates()
```

## is_close

Is the current position close?

**Return Type**: bool

Alias for `self.position.is_close`



## is_long

Is the type of the open position (current trade) `long`?

**Return Type**: bool


## is_open

Is the current position open?

**Return Type**: bool

Alias for `self.position.is_open`


## is_short

Is the type of the open position (current trade) `short`?

**Return Type**: bool

## leverage

The `leverage` property returns the leverage number that you have set in your config file for the exchange you're running inside the strategy. For spot markets, it always returns `1`. 

**Return Type**: int


## liquidate

This method is used to quickly liquidate the open position using a market order. It is a shortcut to use instead of writing:
```py
if self.position.pnl > 0:
    self.take_profit = self.position.qty, self.price
else:
    self.stop_loss = self.position.qty, self.price
```

It is often used within the `update_position` method of strategies that close positions in specific conditions.

**Example**:

Let's open a long position at first [index](#index), and close it at 10th:

```py
def update_position(self):
    if self.index == 10:
        self.liquidate()

def should_long(self):
    return self.index == 0

def go_long(self):
    self.buy = 1, self.price
```


## low

The current candle's low price.

**Return Type**: float

**Example**:

```py
def go_long(self):
    qty = 1

    # open position at 2 dollars above current candle's low
    self.buy = qty, self.high + 2

    # stop-loss at 2 dollars below current candle's low
    self.buy = qty, self.low - 2
```

## metrics

The `metrics` property returns the metrics that you usually would see at the end of backtests. It is useful for coding formulas such as [Kelly Criterion](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/091504.asp).

::: warning
Be aware that without trades it will return `None`.

**Return Type**: dict

## open

The current candle's opening price.

**Return Type**: float

**Example**:

```py
def should_long(self):
    # go long if current candle is bullish
    if self.close > self.open:
        return True

    return False
```

## orders

Returns all the orders submitted by this strategy.

**Return Type**: List[Order]

## position

The position object of the trading route. 

::: tip
Please note that each route instance has only one position which is accessible inside the strategy. It doesn't mean that you cannot trade two positions using one strategy; to do that simply create two routes using the same strategy but with different symbols. 
:::

**Return Type**: Position

```py
# only useful properties are mentioned 
class Position:
    # the (average) entry price of the position | None if position is close
    entry_price: float
    # the quantity of the current position | 0 if position is close
    qty: float
    # the timestamp of when the position opened | None if position is close
    opened_at: float
    # The value of open position
    value: float
    # The type of open position, which can be either short, long, or close
    type: str
    # The PNL of the position
    pnl: float
    # The PNL% of the position
    pnl_percentage: float
    # Is the current position open?
    is_open: bool
    # Is the current position close?
    is_close: bool
```

**Example:**
```py
# if position is in profit by 10%, update stop-loss to break even
def update_position(self):
    if self.position.pnl_percentage >= 10:
        self.stop_loss = self.position.qty, self.position.entry_price
```

**See Also**: [is_long](#is-long), [is_short](#is-short), [is_open](#is-open), [is_close](#is-close)


## price

The current/closing price of the trading symbol at the trading time frame.

**Return Type**: float

**Aliases**: `close`

**Example**:

```py
def go_long(self):
    # buy 1 share at the current price (MARKET order)
    self.buy = 1, self.price
```

## reduced_count

How many times has the position size been reduced since this trade was opened? 

This is useful for strategies that for example exit in multiple points, and you'd like to update something related to it.

**Return Type**: int

**Example**:

```py{12}
def go_long(self):
    self.buy = 1, self.price
    self.stop_loss = 1, self.price - 10
    self.take_profit = [
        (0.5, self.price + 10), 
        (0.5, self.price + 20) 
    ]

def update_position(self):
    # even though we have especified the exit price 
    # for the second half, we now updated to exit with SMA20
    if self.reduced_count > 0:
        self.take_profit = 0.5, self.SMA20

@property
def SMA20(self):
    return ta.sma(self.candles, 20)
```


## shared_vars

`shared_vars` is a dictionary object just like `vars` except that it is shared among all your [routes](/docs/routes). 

You would need `shared_vars` for writing strategies that require more than one route, and when those routes need to communicate with each other. 

`shared_vars` could act as a bridge. One example could be in a pairs trading strategy which requires two routes to communicate with each other (one goes long when the other goes short)

**Return Type**: dict

**See Also**: [vars](#vars)


## time

The current UTC timestamp.

**Return Type**: int

## trades

Returns all the completed trades for this strategy.

**Return Type**: List[CompletedTrade]

## vars

`vars` is the name of a dictionary object present in your strategy that you can use as a placeholder for your variables. 

Of course, you could define your own variables inside `__init__` instead, but that would bring a concern about naming your variables to prevent conflict with built-in variables and properties.

Using `vars` would also make it easier for debugging.


**Return Type**: dict
